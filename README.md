This project was initially created as a birthday present for a friend, but I realised that the community might appreciate this project, and may be able to improve on it in ways I never could.


This device supports MIDI output, keyboard emulation for [Sky Music Nightly](https://specy.github.io/skyMusic), and keyboard emulation for the PC port of Sky.
