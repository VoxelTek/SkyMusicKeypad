# SkyMusic
 
A 5x3 MX button grid connected to an RP2040-Zero, intended for playing music in the same style as seen in Sky: Children Of The Light.

This project was initially created as a birthday present for a friend, but I realised that the community might appreciate this project, and may be able to improve on it in ways I never could.


With the release of the PC demo version, and its alleged ability to play in-game using MIDI devices, the project should be able to interface with the Sky game itself and play music this way.
